Instructions:1.	Open terminal and make sure that you are in the same directory as my script files.2.	My script uses the httparty gem, version 0.14.0, and it is required in the file.3.	In the terminal type (without quotes) ’ruby winning_movies.rb’ and the terminal should display the information for the winning movies as well as a budget average for the winning movies at the end.Average Budget of all the winners (that had budgets listed) (in US dollars): $17,227,572Brief Summary:I knew that I first had to get the data from the API site and I recently worked with HTTParty and decided to try that.  Once I got the JSON data, I played with the code in the terminal to see how I wanted to format the data and did some research on regex to remove bits of String that I didn’t want. I kept checking for edge cases every time I ran into some data that wasn’t formatted correctly, and accounted for them in my code.  After that I needed to convert all the budgets to integers, replacing the word “million”.  I also needed to ensure that all the budgets were in US dollars so that I could find out the average amount, thus I multiplied US dollars by 1.29 for British Pound conversion. I also temporarily saved the data to text files so that I could review and check for any issues.  At the end, once I had everything working, I began cleaning up my code so that individual pieces were in separate methods of around 5 lines.
